        <h2>What's This About?</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a demonstration of how different HTML elements behave with Angular's 
            click and keyup.enter event handlers. Proper use of the keyup.enter event handler is 
            critical to maintain site usability for keyboard-exclusive users and is therefore 
            critical to follow

        <h2>How These Event Handlers Work</h2>
        <p>
            Both event handlers have straightforward names. The click handler is declared on an 
            HTML element along with a quoted template statement. Angular event binding will listen 
            for the element's click event and call the template statement. The keyup.enter event 
            listener follows the same pattern, with the Angular event binding instead listening 
            for the element's keyup enter event. The standard practice is to call a single 
            function to handle the event.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following is an example of the click and keyup.enter event handlers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;button (click)="myClickFunction()"&gt;Submit{{'/button' | htmlTag}}</code><br />
            <code>&lt;button (keyup.enter)="myEnterFunction()"&gt;Submit{{'/button' | htmlTag}}</code>
        </p>
        <h2>Using These Event Handlers Properly</h2>
        <p>
            The click event handler works consistently and as expected. All elements with a click 
            event handler on them will run their function when clicked. The keyup.enter function 
            is is also consistent. All elements with a keyup.enter handler will run their function 
            when enter is pressed while the element is focused.
        </p>
        <p>
            Problems do sometimes arise when both event handlers are combined. While in most cases 
            combining both event handlers is necessary, that is not the case with button elements. 
            This is because the click event will be activated by pressing enter on a button, 
            something that does not happen with other elements. This means that if both click and 
            keyup.enter are used on a button element they will each be activated when a user presses 
            enter.
